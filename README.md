# Amortization
I will write a Python computer program to do the following:

•	Get user input of principal, minimum expected payment, interest, and extra payment, and error check that all input is valid. If not valid, have the user re-enter. Note that one does not need to enter the term of the loan.

•	Compute and print the schedule of payments, similar to the table shown above.

•	Compute and print the total (sum of all) payments, interest paid, and principal applied.

•	Compute and print the total time (in years) required to payoff the loan.
